 # Project Context

This repository is an OpenSpec-driven project scaffold used for spec-first development. It contains the OpenSpec tooling directives, change proposals, and capability specs under `openspec/`.

NOTE: I inferred some details below where the repository did not explicitly state them. See "Assumptions".

## Purpose

- Course/work assignment: AIOT hw3 (author: repository owner).
- Use OpenSpec to propose, review, implement, and archive behavioral changes as human-readable spec deltas.

## Primary components

- `openspec/project.md` - project conventions (follow first when in doubt)
- `openspec/specs/` - current production capabilities (truth)
- `openspec/changes/` - proposed changes (work-in-progress)

## Tech stack and tools (inferred)

- Authoring: Markdown-based specs and proposals
- Spec tooling: `openspec` CLI (project-provided CLI)
- Search: `ripgrep` (rg) for full-text search guidance
- VCS: `git` (branch-per-change workflow recommended)
- Shell / automation: Windows PowerShell is used in this environment; scripts should work from PowerShell
- Optional: Node.js for small automation scripts (if needed)

## Conventions

- Change IDs: kebab-case, verb-led (e.g., `add-two-factor-auth`, `update-payment-flow`)
- Change location: `openspec/changes/<change-id>/`
  - `proposal.md` - Why, what, and impact
  - `tasks.md` - Implementation checklist
  - `design.md` (optional) - Technical decisions
  - `specs/` - Deltas per capability (one capability per file)
- Scenarios: Use `#### Scenario: Name` header (exactly 4 hashtags) and include `WHEN`/`THEN` lines (see `openspec/AGENTS.md`)
- Branching: Use `change/<change-id>` branch for implementation and PRs
- Validation: Run `openspec validate <change-id> --strict` before requesting approval

## How to propose a change (short)

1. Pick a unique change-id and scaffold `openspec/changes/<id>` with `proposal.md` and `tasks.md`.
2. Add spec deltas under `openspec/changes/<id>/specs/<capability>/spec.md` using `## ADDED|MODIFIED|REMOVED Requirements` and `#### Scenario:` blocks.
3. Validate with `openspec validate <id> --strict` and request review.

## Files to review first

- `openspec/AGENTS.md` - agent instructions and spec format (authoritative)
- `openspec/project.md` - project conventions and guidelines
- `openspec/specs/` - existing capability specs

## Assumptions made

1. This is an OpenSpec-first repository (specs drive implementation).
2. Primary tooling is markdown + `openspec` CLI; no explicit build system was found in repository context.

If any of the above assumptions are incorrect, tell me and I will update this document.
